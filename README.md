# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis-SQL  

## üìå About  
This project aims to explore the Walmart Sales data to understand:  
- Top performing branches and products  
- Sales trend of different products  
- Customer behaviour  

The aim is to study how sales strategies can be improved and optimized.  
The dataset was obtained from the **Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition**.  

> "In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact." ‚Äî *Source: Kaggle*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach Used  

1. **Data Wrangling**  
   - Inspected data for NULL/missing values  
   - Used NOT NULL constraints in schema design to prevent NULLs  

2. **Build Database**  
   - Created tables and inserted data  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Added new column `time_of_day` ‚Üí Morning / Afternoon / Evening  
   - Added new column `day_name` ‚Üí Day of week (Mon, Tue, etc.)  
   - Added new column `month_name` ‚Üí Month of year (Jan, Feb, etc.)  

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Performed queries to answer project business questions

## üßÆ Revenue & Profit Calculations  

- **COGS** = unit_price √ó quantity  
- **VAT** = 5% √ó COGS  
- **Total (gross sales)** = COGS + VAT  
- **Gross Income** = Total ‚àí COGS  
- **Gross Margin %** = Gross Income √∑ Total Revenue  

### Example (from first row in DB):  
- Unit Price = 45.79  
- Quantity = 7  
- **COGS** = 45.79 √ó 7 = 320.53  
- **VAT** = 5% √ó 320.53 = 16.0265  
- **Total** = 320.53 + 16.0265 = 336.5565  
- **Gross Margin %** = 16.0265 √∑ 336.5565 ‚âà 4.76%
